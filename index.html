            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Jacob Higham! I was born on Febuary 24th, 1998 in Sacramento,CA.</p>
            <p>I served three years in the U.S. Army's 25th Infantry Division as a rifleman and Radiotelephone Operator.
                I was stationed in Schofield Barracks, Hawaii and was assigned to 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry Regiment,
                Alpha Company 2nd Platoon. I finished my service as a Sergeant after recieving the promotion in the
                inactive reserves.</p>
            <p>After finishing my service in the military, I earned my Emergency Medical Technician license in 2019 and
                provided 911 services to Northern California, working mainly in the Sacramento and Stockton areas. I
                specialized in traumatic injuries and also served as a Field Training Officer for new and student EMTs.
            </p>
            <p>While working as an EMT, I started work on an International Studies degree and am conversationaly fluent
                in Japanese! まだまだ学ぶことがたくさんある！</p>
            <p>Currently, I'm learning to code through the bootcamp at UC Davis, I've found that I have a love of Web
                Development and am looking forward to advancing and getting better at it!</p>
