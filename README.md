## Description

This assignment was to build a professional portfolio that I will be updating periodically.
I used everything I've learned with HTML and CSS to create a portfolio that includes links to previous assignments.
The objective of this is to have a professional portfolio that is fully fleshed out by the end of the bootcamp.
